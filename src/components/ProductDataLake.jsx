      The future of geothermal will relies on such collaborative digital platforms 
      that break data silos and drive efficiency. Organizations like the European Geothermal 
      Energy Council (EGEC) and US Department of Energyâ€™s Geothermal Data Repository are 
      pushing for more open data sharing initiatives.
